## The Big Picture

This week we're seeing a fascinating convergence of whale activity and congressional trading that paints a clear picture: smart money is positioning for AI infrastructure expansion.

## Whale Activity Highlights

### Accumulation Patterns

Three major wallets we track have been steadily accumulating tokens in the compute/infrastructure sector:

- **Wallet 0x7a3...** added $2.3M in RNDR over 72 hours
- **Wallet 0x9f1...** rotated $1.8M from memecoins into TAO
- **Known fund wallet** made its largest SOL purchase since November

This isn't random. These wallets have historically front-run major ecosystem announcements by 2-3 weeks.

### Distribution Signals

Meanwhile, we're seeing distribution from whales who accumulated during the December rally:

- Gaming tokens seeing consistent selling pressure
- DeFi blue chips flat despite broader market strength
- Memecoins experiencing whale exits (finally)

## Congressional Trading Intel

### The Energy Committee Connection

Three members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee filed trades this week that caught our attention:

1. **Rep. Johnson (R-TX)** - Purchased $50K-$100K in NextEra Energy
2. **Rep. Martinez (D-CA)** - Sold $15K-$50K in traditional oil majors
3. **Rep. Williams (R-OH)** - New position in uranium ETF

All three trades were filed within 48 hours of each other. The committee has a closed-door briefing scheduled for next week on "Critical Energy Infrastructure for AI Development."

### Historical Pattern Match

This clustering of energy trades mirrors what we saw in Q3 2025 before the Infrastructure Modernization Act passed. Committee members who traded ahead of that announcement saw 23% average gains.

## What We're Watching

1. **AI compute tokens** - If whale accumulation continues, expect a breakout within 2 weeks
2. **Energy sector** - Congressional trading suggests bullish catalyst incoming
3. **Memecoin rotation** - Whale exits signal the end of this cycle's speculation phase

## Action Items for Pro Subscribers

- Set alerts on RNDR, TAO, and compute-related tokens
- Watch for unusual options activity in energy stocks
- Consider taking profits on gaming/memecoin positions
